**What are microservices?**

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably - a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.
